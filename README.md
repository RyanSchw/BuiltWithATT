Example scenario:
A medical emergency is happening in apartment 301 of the apartment complex. This medical emergency requires the immediate attention of EMS personnel. When EMS approach the door to the apartment complex, they find it is locked. Without much time to spare, they are forced to break open the door to attend to the injured person.

Now, imagine our tool in this scenario. The first responders are able to use our app to be granted access to the building, saving crucial time to attend to the patient. In addition, this lock can be installed in the door to the apartment, so EMS personnel are able to enter the apartment with ease. This saves time, money (replacement of the door), and generally improves the process of gaining access to an emergency area.

Other scenarios could include fire alarm calls (without visible smoke) and burglary alarm calls - these sort of calls may not necessitate the use of force entry but still require the call to be attended to.

In general, our IoT / software solution grants emergency personnel access to buildings with the consent of the building owners. This can be used for many types of buildings, including high-density residential applications, but also schools, offices, and homes. Using the FirstNet network, emergency personnel are already authenticated with our app and are able to simply scan the QR code and enter the building.

Future ideas include commercialization of this product, allowing for residents to use this app to gain entry to the building, and allow for one-time-use authorizations for guests of the complex.
